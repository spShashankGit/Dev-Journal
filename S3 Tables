# S3 Tables

Originally build: 2006
Idea: Store the data securely & durably have it available when needed.
Envisioned filed stored: Video, Photos and other static content
Current usage: Data used for Analytics, Machine Learning and AI 
Usage: Meterological data, financial transactions and records
Format: Apache Parquet (Tabular format)

Problem with Parquet datafiles: Evolving the schema was difficult because adding and removing columns means that efforts is spent in making sure data can be consumed at speeed at scale. Does this mean we need to update schema in each and every application?
Iceberg: Adds metadata file, metadata allows to structure the data, safe transactions, time-travel, SQL semantic, allows consistency of the data

Iceberg features
1. Time travel
2. Schema information
3. Compaction
