# Geneva Convention: A Comprehensive Guide

## What is a convention?
An agreement between states for regulation of matters affecting all of them [5]

## What is the Geneva Convention?
The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols are international treaties that contain the most important rules limiting the barbarity of war. They protect people who do not take part in the fighting (civilians, medics, aid workers) and those who can no longer fight (wounded, sick and shipwrecked troops, prisoners of war) [4]

The conference developed and approved four conventions:
1. The Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field
2. The Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea
3. The Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, and
4. The Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. [3]

## Staring point: ICRC
Founding of ICRC(International Committee of the Red Cross) in 1863 put Geneva on world map.
Upon initiation of ICRC, Swiss goverment invited 15 european nations and US to discuss adoption of a convention to inmprove conditions for wounded soldiers in battlefields. This happened in August 1864. [1]

## First convention - 1864
ICRC drafted the treaty which state the obligation to provide the medical aid to wounded soldiers regardless of nationality and the use of distinctive emblem - a red cross on a white background - to specfically identify medical services.
The text was adopted on 22 August 1864 and immediately signed by 12 presetnt state at the conference.
The 1864 convention became the first universal and lasting treaty of international humanataria law.
After this convention Geneva was seen as neutral location for the diplimatic negotiations. [1]
This convention contains 64 articles [6]

## Second Geneva Convention - 1906
12 August 1949
The protection of wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of the armed forces at sea was regulated for the first time in a Geneva Convetion. 
Prior to this, the rules on the protection of the wounded, sick and shipwrecked during naval warfare were codified in the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, which adapted the principles of the Geneva Conventions on the wounded and sick to naval warfare.
Since the text of the Convention is to be posted in all prisoner of war camps (see Article 41) it has to be comprehensible not only to the authorities but also to the ordinary reader at any time. 

The convntion contains 63 articles. [7]

## Third Geneva Convention - 1929
The present Convention replaced the Prisoners of War Convention of 1929. 
It contains 143 Articles whereas the 1929 Convention had only 97. 
It became necessary to revise the 1929 Convention on a number of points owing to the changes that had occurred in the conduct of warfare and the consequences thereof, as well as in the living condition of peoples.

Experience had shown that the daily life of prisoners depended specifically on the interpretation given to the general regulations. 
Consequently, certain regulations were given a more explicit form which was lacking in the preceding provisions. 

The categories of persons entitled to prisoner of war status were broadened in accordance with Conventions I and II. 

The conditions and places of captivity were more precisely defined, in particular with regard to the labour of prisoners of war, their financial resources, the relief they receive and the judicial proceedings instituted against them.

The Convention establishes the principle that prisoners of war must be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities (Article 118).

The updated Commentary on this Convention was published online on 20 June 2020 and takes into account developments up to this date.

## Fourth Geneva Convention - 1949




## Why is Switzerland called 'CH'?
Latin name Confoederatio Helvetica, meaning Swiss Confederation.
Latin was chosen as a neutral language, since Switzerland has four official languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh), and Latin avoids favoring any one group.

## Is CH still used in current day?
The name Helvetia refers to the Helvetii, a Celtic tribe that lived in the region during the Roman era. Today, the Latin name still appears on Swiss coins, stamps, and even on international car license plates.
