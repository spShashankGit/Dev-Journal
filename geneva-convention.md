## What is the Geneva Convention?
The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols are international treaties that contain the most important rules limiting the barbarity of war. They protect people who do not take part in the fighting (civilians, medics, aid workers) and those who can no longer fight (wounded, sick and shipwrecked troops, prisoners of war) [4]

The conference developed and approved four conventions
1. The Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field
2. The Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea
3. The Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, and
4. The Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. [3]

## Why is Switzerland called 'CH'?
Latin name Confoederatio Helvetica, meaning Swiss Confederation.
Latin was chosen as a neutral language, since Switzerland has four official languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh), and Latin avoids favoring any one group.

## Is CH still used in current day?
The name Helvetia refers to the Helvetii, a Celtic tribe that lived in the region during the Roman era. Today, the Latin name still appears on Swiss coins, stamps, and even on international car license plates.
