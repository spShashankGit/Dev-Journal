## Conclusion

The Geneva Convention represents one of humanity's most significant achievements in establishing legal protections for those affected by armed conflict. Its principles of distinction, proportionality, precaution, and humanity continue to provide essential guidance for military operations, humanitarian assistance, and international justice.

Understanding the Geneva Convention is crucial for:
- **Military professionals** planning and executing operations
- **Humanitarian workers** providing assistance in conflict zones
- **Legal practitioners** working in international law
- **Policy makers** developing conflict response strategies
- **Citizens** understanding their rights and protections

As warfare evolves with new technologies and forms of conflict, the core humanitarian principles established by the Geneva Convention remain as relevant today as they were in 1949. The challenge lies in adapting these timeless principles to contemporary realities while maintaining their protective purpose.

## Why is Switzerland called 'CH'?
Latin name Confoederatio Helvetica, meaning Swiss Confederation.
Latin was chosen as a neutral language, since Switzerland has four official languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh), and Latin avoids favoring any one group.

## Is CH still used in current day?
The name Helvetia refers to the Helvetii, a Celtic tribe that lived in the region during the Roman era. Today, the Latin name still appears on Swiss coins, stamps, and even on international car license plates.
