# Renaissance Developer

Framework

1. You need to be curoiopis _ You have to continuously learn - everything changes all the time. Curiosily leads to learning and invention
2. To experiment - you need to be willing to fail. Experiment is not an experiment if you already knows the outcome. Willingness to fail is necessry.
Get it worng and gently be corrected. It is the failed build, the broken assumption that really teaches you how system works.
3. Reading , watching , listening can only take you to far -> Real learnign happens when there is a pressure of outcome
4. Learning is social - talk about system, coffee, beast way to be sharp, be around the people who are building. This tells us how people are using the technology and not how we think they might.
