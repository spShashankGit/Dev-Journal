# Croissant Metadata: A Comprehensive Guide

*Note: This guide provides an educational overview of Croissant metadata based on available research and community information. For the most current and authoritative details, please refer to the original research paper and official documentation.*

## What is Croissant Metadata?

Croissant is a high-level format for machine learning datasets that aims to make datasets more discoverable, interoperable, and responsible. It's a metadata standard developed through a collaborative effort involving major organizations in the ML ecosystem, including Google, Hugging Face, Kaggle, and others.

The name "Croissant" reflects the format's layered approach to metadata description, much like the layers in the French pastry. It provides a structured way to describe datasets with rich metadata that goes beyond simple file listings.

## What Does Croissant Metadata Mean?

Croissant metadata represents a standardized vocabulary and schema for describing machine learning datasets comprehensively. It extends the widely-adopted schema.org vocabulary to include ML-specific concepts and requirements.

### Key Concepts:
