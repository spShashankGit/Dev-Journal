## What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard that enables AI assistants and applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. It acts as a universal protocol that allows AI models to interact with various services, databases, APIs, and tools in a standardized and secure manner.

### Key Concepts:
- **Protocol**: A standardized communication framework
- **Context**: Providing AI models with access to external information and capabilities
- **Servers**: Applications that implement the MCP protocol to expose data and tools
- **Clients**: AI assistants or applications that connect to MCP servers

Think of MCP as a "universal adapter" that allows AI assistants to connect to virtually any external service or data source through a consistent interface.
