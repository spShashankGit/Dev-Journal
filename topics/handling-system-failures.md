# Handling System Failures: When Source Systems Are Down

## Overview

When dealing with distributed systems, source system failures are inevitable. This document explores various strategies and patterns for handling failures gracefully to maintain system reliability and user experience.

## Types of System Failures

### 1. Complete System Outage
- **Description**: The entire source system becomes unavailable
- **Causes**: Hardware failure, network partitions, software crashes, deployment issues
- **Duration**: Can range from minutes to hours

### 2. Partial Degradation
- **Description**: Some components work while others fail
- **Causes**: Resource exhaustion, database connection issues, API rate limiting
- **Impact**: Reduced functionality rather than complete failure

### 3. Intermittent Failures
- **Description**: Sporadic failures that come and go
- **Causes**: Network instability, load spikes, race conditions
- **Challenge**: Difficult to diagnose and reproduce

## Strategies for Handling Source System Failures

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by detecting when a service is failing and temporarily stopping requests to it.

**States:**
- **Closed**: Normal operation, requests flow through
- **Open**: Failure detected, requests are blocked and fail fast
- **Half-Open**: Testing if service has recovered

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Define failure thresholds (error rate, response time)
- Set appropriate timeout periods
- Implement gradual recovery testing
- Monitor circuit breaker states

### 2. Retry Mechanisms with Exponential Backoff

**Basic Retry Strategy:**
- Retry failed requests with increasing delays
- Prevent overwhelming the failing system
- Set maximum retry limits

**Exponential Backoff Formula:**
```
delay = base_delay * (2 ^ attempt_number) + jitter
```

**Best Practices:**
- Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Implement different retry policies for different error types
- Consider idempotency for safe retries
- Set circuit breakers to prevent infinite retries

### 3. Fallback Strategies

**Cached Data Fallback:**
- Serve stale data from cache when source is unavailable
- Define cache expiration policies
- Implement cache warming strategies

**Default Value Fallback:**
- Return sensible default values
- Use historical data or averages
- Maintain user experience with degraded functionality

**Alternative Service Fallback:**
- Route to backup or alternative services
- Implement service discovery and health checks
- Consider data consistency implications

### 4. Graceful Degradation

**Feature Toggles:**
- Disable non-essential features during outages
- Maintain core functionality
- Communicate feature availability to users

**Reduced Functionality Mode:**
- Offer limited but functional alternatives
- Queue non-critical operations for later processing
- Prioritize critical user flows

### 5. Health Checks and Monitoring

**Proactive Health Monitoring:**
- Implement deep health checks beyond simple ping
- Monitor key metrics (response time, error rate, throughput)
- Set up alerts with appropriate thresholds

**Dependency Health Tracking:**
- Monitor health of all dependencies
- Implement health check aggregation
- Use health checks for load balancer decisions

### 6. Load Balancing and Failover

**Multi-Instance Deployment:**
- Deploy across multiple availability zones
- Implement automatic failover mechanisms
- Use health-aware load balancers

**Geographic Distribution:**
- Deploy in multiple regions
- Implement DNS-based failover
- Consider data replication latency

### 7. Data Persistence and Backup Strategies

**Event Sourcing:**
- Store events rather than current state
- Enable system reconstruction after failures
- Provide audit trail for failure analysis

**Data Replication:**
- Maintain synchronized replicas
- Implement read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Consider eventual consistency trade-offs

**Backup and Recovery:**
- Regular automated backups
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Bulkhead Pattern
Isolate critical resources to prevent failure cascade:
- Separate connection pools for different services
- Isolate CPU and memory resources
- Use separate thread pools for different operations

### 2. Timeout Pattern
Prevent resource exhaustion from slow responses:
- Set appropriate timeouts for all external calls
- Implement both connection and read timeouts
- Consider different timeout values for different operations

### 3. Rate Limiting
Control load to prevent system overload:
- Implement client-side rate limiting
- Use token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms
- Apply rate limiting at different levels (user, API, system)

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Response Time**: Latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage
- **Circuit Breaker State**: Open/closed status

### Alerting Strategy
- **Immediate Alerts**: Critical system failures
- **Warning Alerts**: Degraded performance or approaching thresholds
- **Trend Alerts**: Gradual degradation over time

### Logging Best Practices
- Structure logs for easy searching and analysis
- Include correlation IDs for tracing requests
- Log retry attempts and circuit breaker state changes
- Implement different log levels for different scenarios

## Testing Failure Scenarios

### Chaos Engineering
- Intentionally introduce failures in production
- Test system resilience under various failure conditions
- Validate monitoring and alerting systems
- Build confidence in failure handling capabilities

### Disaster Recovery Drills
- Regularly test backup and recovery procedures
- Simulate different failure scenarios
- Measure actual RTO and RPO
- Document and improve procedures based on results

## Communication During Outages

### Internal Communication
- Establish clear escalation procedures
- Use dedicated communication channels for incidents
- Provide regular status updates to stakeholders
- Document incident timeline and decisions

### External Communication
- Prepare status page templates
- Communicate impact and expected resolution time
- Provide workarounds when available
- Follow up with post-incident summaries

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Design for Failure**: Assume components will fail and design accordingly
2. **Fail Fast**: Detect failures quickly and avoid long timeouts
3. **Isolate Failures**: Prevent failures from cascading to other systems
4. **Monitor Everything**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
5. **Test Regularly**: Continuously test failure scenarios and recovery procedures
6. **Document Procedures**: Maintain clear runbooks for common failure scenarios
7. **Learn from Failures**: Conduct post-mortems and improve system resilience

## Conclusion

Handling source system failures effectively requires a combination of proactive design patterns, monitoring, and operational procedures. The key is to build resilience into the system from the ground up, rather than trying to add it as an afterthought. By implementing these strategies, systems can maintain functionality and user experience even when dependencies fail.

Remember: The goal is not to eliminate failures entirely (which is impossible), but to handle them gracefully and minimize their impact on users and business operations.
