# Handling Downstream System Failures

## Question: How do you handle the failure when downstream system is down?

This is a critical aspect of building resilient distributed systems. When a downstream service is unavailable, your system needs to handle the failure gracefully to maintain overall system stability and user experience.

## Key Strategies and Patterns

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern
The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service.

**States:**
- **Closed**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **Open**: Service is failing, requests are immediately rejected
- **Half-Open**: Testing if service has recovered

**Benefits:**
- Prevents resource exhaustion
- Fails fast instead of waiting for timeouts
- Allows system to recover

### 2. Retry Mechanisms
Implement intelligent retry logic for transient failures.

**Best Practices:**
- Use exponential backoff with jitter
- Set maximum retry attempts
- Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable errors
- Implement retry budgets to prevent retry storms

**Example Strategy:**
```
Initial delay: 100ms
Max retries: 3
Backoff multiplier: 2
Max delay: 5s
```

### 3. Timeout Handling
Set appropriate timeouts to prevent hanging requests.

**Timeout Types:**
- **Connection timeout**: Time to establish connection
- **Read timeout**: Time to receive response
- **Overall timeout**: Total time for entire operation

### 4. Graceful Degradation
Provide reduced functionality when downstream services are unavailable.

**Approaches:**
- Serve cached data
- Provide default values
- Skip non-essential features
- Show user-friendly error messages

### 5. Fallback Mechanisms
Implement alternative paths when primary service fails.

**Fallback Options:**
- Secondary service instances
- Cached responses
- Static default responses
- Alternative service providers

### 6. Bulkhead Isolation
Isolate critical resources to prevent failure propagation.

**Implementation:**
- Separate thread pools for different services
- Resource quotas per downstream service
- Independent connection pools

### 7. Asynchronous Processing
Use queues and async patterns to handle downstream failures.

**Benefits:**
- Decouple request processing from downstream availability
- Enable retry logic at queue level
- Maintain system responsiveness

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Error rates**: Track 4xx and 5xx responses
- **Latency**: Monitor response times and percentiles
- **Availability**: Measure uptime and downtime
- **Circuit breaker state**: Monitor open/closed states
- **Retry attempts**: Track retry patterns and success rates

### Alerting Strategy
- Set up alerts for error rate thresholds
- Monitor circuit breaker trips
- Alert on timeout increases
- Track downstream service health

## Implementation Considerations

### Configuration Management
- Make timeouts and retry policies configurable
- Allow runtime adjustment of circuit breaker thresholds
- Enable/disable features based on downstream health

### Testing Strategies
- **Chaos engineering**: Intentionally introduce failures
- **Load testing**: Test behavior under stress
- **Failure injection**: Simulate downstream failures
- **Recovery testing**: Verify system recovery after failures

### Documentation and Runbooks
- Document failure scenarios and responses
- Create runbooks for common issues
- Maintain service dependency maps
- Document rollback procedures

## Example Architecture Pattern

```
Client Request
    ↓
Load Balancer
    ↓
API Gateway (with circuit breaker)
    ↓
Service A (with retry logic)
    ↓
Circuit Breaker → Downstream Service B
    ↓               ↓
Fallback Cache ← Success/Failure
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Fail Fast**: Don't wait indefinitely for failing services
2. **Degrade Gracefully**: Provide reduced functionality rather than complete failure
3. **Monitor Everything**: Track metrics to understand system behavior
4. **Test Failures**: Regularly test failure scenarios
5. **Plan Recovery**: Have clear procedures for service recovery
6. **Communicate**: Provide clear error messages to users
7. **Learn and Improve**: Conduct post-mortems and improve resilience
