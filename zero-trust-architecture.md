# Zero Trust Architecture
*Based on NIST Special Publication 800-207*

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-207. Zero Trust Architecture represents a paradigm shift from traditional perimeter-based security models to a comprehensive security framework that treats all users, devices, and network traffic as untrusted.

## What is Zero Trust Architecture? (NIST Definition)

According to NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture is an enterprise's cybersecurity plan that uses zero trust principles and encompasses component relationships, workflow planning, and access policies. Zero trust provides a collection of concepts and ideas designed to minimize uncertainty in enforcing accurate, least privilege per-request access decisions in information systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised.

Zero trust architecture is a security model, a set of system design principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy based on an acknowledgment that threats exist both inside and outside traditional network boundaries.

## Zero Trust Principles (Per NIST SP 800-207)

The zero trust security model is based on the following tenets:

### 1. All data sources and computing services are considered resources
- No distinction between internal and external resources
- All enterprise resources require protection regardless of location

### 2. All communication is secured regardless of network location
- Network location alone does not imply trust
- Encryption and authentication for all communications

### 3. Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis
- Trust is never implicit and must be continuously evaluated
- Sessions are authenticated and authorized before establishing access

### 4. Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy
- Policies include identity, application/service, requesting asset, and environmental factors
- Risk-based authentication and authorization

### 5. The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated assets
- Continuous asset monitoring and assessment
- Real-time security posture evaluation

### 6. All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed
- No static trust relationships
- Continuous verification throughout the session

### 7. The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of assets, network infrastructure, and communications
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Data-driven security decisions

## Logical Components of Zero Trust Architecture (NIST Framework)

Zero Trust Architecture consists of three main logical components that work together to provide secure access:

### 1. Policy Engine (PE)
The Policy Engine is the core component responsible for making access decisions. It:

- **Grants, denies, or revokes access** to enterprise resources for a given subject
- **Evaluates requests** against enterprise policy and external sources
- **Considers multiple factors** including:
  - Subject identity and credentials
  - Application or service being requested
  - Requesting asset (device) and its security posture
  - Environmental attributes (time, location, requesting network)
  - Risk analytics and threat intelligence
- **Makes decisions** using both enterprise policy and real-time risk assessment
- **Operates continuously** throughout the session, not just at initial authentication

### 2. Policy Administrator (PA)
The Policy Administrator acts as the communication pathway between the Policy Engine and Policy Enforcement Points. It:

- **Establishes and shuts down** the communication path between subject and resource
- **Generates access tokens or credentials** for the subject to access enterprise resources
- **Communicates** with the Policy Enforcement Point to allow or deny access
- **Receives** requests from subjects and forwards policy decisions
- **May consult** external policy repositories for dynamic policy updates

### 3. Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)
The Policy Enforcement Point is responsible for enabling, monitoring, and eventually terminating connections. It:

- **Forwards requests** to the Policy Administrator
- **Receives policy updates** from the Policy Administrator
- **Enforces policy decisions** by allowing or denying access to resources
- **Monitors traffic** for compliance with established policies
- **Terminates connections** when policy violations are detected
- **Examples include**: Next-generation firewalls, web gateways, cloud access security brokers, network access control systems

## Core ZTA Logical Components Interaction Flow

1. **Subject** requests access to an enterprise resource
2. **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)** receives the request and forwards it to the Policy Administrator
3. **Policy Administrator (PA)** forwards the request to the Policy Engine for evaluation
4. **Policy Engine (PE)** evaluates the request against policy and contextual information
5. **Policy Engine** returns a decision (allow/deny) to the Policy Administrator
6. **Policy Administrator** configures the Policy Enforcement Point and issues access credentials
7. **Policy Enforcement Point** allows or denies the connection and monitors ongoing activity

The NIST framework provides organizations with a structured approach to implementing Zero Trust principles through well-defined logical components, deployment models, and implementation strategies.

Key takeaways from the NIST Zero Trust Architecture framework include:

- **Comprehensive Security Model**: ZTA addresses the reality of modern distributed computing environments where traditional network perimeters are no longer sufficient
- **Risk-Based Decision Making**: Continuous evaluation of risk factors enables dynamic and contextual access decisions
- **Technology Agnostic**: The framework can be implemented using various technologies and vendor solutions while maintaining consistent security principles
- **Gradual Implementation**: Organizations can adopt Zero Trust incrementally, building on existing security investments while addressing current limitations

Successful Zero Trust implementation requires careful planning, executive support, and a cross-functional approach that considers technical, operational, and business requirements. Organizations should focus on establishing strong identity management foundations, implementing comprehensive monitoring, and developing risk-based policies that align with business objectives.

As cyber threats continue to evolve and organizations increasingly adopt cloud computing, remote work, and digital transformation initiatives, Zero Trust Architecture provides a resilient and adaptive security framework that can scale to meet future challenges while maintaining strong security posture.
