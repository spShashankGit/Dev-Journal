## Layered Architecture (N-tier)

### Description
The layered architecture pattern organizes the system into horizontal layers, where each layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.

### Common Layers
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface and user interaction
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core business rules and processing
- **Data Access Layer**: Database interactions and data persistence
- **Database Layer**: Actual data storage

### When to Use
- Traditional enterprise applications
- Applications with clear separation of concerns
- When team members have different expertise areas
- Monolithic applications with well-defined responsibilities

### Pros
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand and maintain

## Clean Architecture

### Description
Clean Architecture, proposed by Robert C. Martin, emphasizes the separation of concerns and independence from frameworks, databases, and external agencies.

### Layers (from inside out)
1. **Entities**: Enterprise business rules
2. **Use Cases**: Application business rules
3. **Interface Adapters**: Controllers, gateways, presenters
4. **Frameworks & Drivers**: Database, web framework, external interfaces

### When to Use
- Long-term, maintainable applications
- Applications where business rules are complex
- When framework independence is important
- Test-driven development environments

### Pros
- Framework independence

## Model-View-Controller (MVC)

### Description
MVC separates an application into three interconnected components to separate internal representations from how information is presented to the user.

### Components
- **Model**: Manages data and business logic
- **View**: Handles the display of information
- **Controller**: Manages user input and coordinates Model and View

### When to Use
- Web applications
- Desktop GUI applications
- Applications requiring multiple views of the same data
- When separation of UI and business logic is important

### Pros
- Clear separation of concerns
- Supports multiple views
- Easier parallel development
- Good for user interface applications

### Cons
- Can be complex for simple applications
- Tight coupling between View and Controller
- Not suitable for all types of applications
- Can lead to fat controllers

---

## Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

### Description
MVVM is similar to MVC but introduces a ViewModel that acts as a binding layer between the View and the Model.

### Components
- **Model**: Data and business logic
- **View**: User interface
- **ViewModel**: Abstraction of the view, handles view logic and state

### When to Use
- Applications with data binding capabilities
- WPF, Silverlight, or similar framework applications
- When you want declarative data binding
- Rich client applications

### Pros
- Strong data binding support
- Better testability than MVC
- Clear separation of UI and business logic
- Supports two-way data binding

### Cons
- Can be complex for simple views
- Requires framework support for data binding

## Choosing the Right Pattern

When selecting an architecture pattern, consider:

1. **Application Size and Complexity**: Simple applications may not need complex patterns
2. **Team Size and Structure**: Larger teams may benefit from patterns that enable parallel development
3. **Scalability Requirements**: High-traffic applications may need patterns that support horizontal scaling
4. **Performance Requirements**: Some patterns introduce overhead that may not be suitable for high-performance applications
5. **Maintainability**: Consider long-term maintenance and evolution of the system
6. **Technology Stack**: Some patterns work better with specific technologies
7. **Business Requirements**: Audit trails, real-time processing, etc., may dictate certain patterns

Remember that these patterns are not mutually exclusive and can often be combined to create hybrid architectures that best serve your specific needs.
