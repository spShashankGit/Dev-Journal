# Dev-Journal
This repository is essentially a conversation with myself where I am listing the topics that I want to lean and understand. Over the period of time I want to write my notes in comments and increase the knowledge bank.

## Topics Covered

- [Work Package of an Architect](architect-work-package.md) - Comprehensive guide covering daily activities, pitfalls to avoid, staying current with technology, work-life balance, and success metrics for software architects.
