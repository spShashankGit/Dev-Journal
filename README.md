# Dev-Journal
This repository is essentially a conversation with myself where I am listing the topics that I want to lean and understand. Over the period of time I want to write my notes in comments and increase the knowledge bank.

## How to Use This Journal

Each topic is documented in its own markdown file with:
- Clear explanations of concepts
- Practical examples and code samples
- Real-world use cases
- Best practices and implementation guidelines
- References for further learning

Feel free to explore the topics and use this as a reference for engineering concepts, patterns, and various technical subjects.
