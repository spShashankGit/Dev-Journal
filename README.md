# Dev-Journal
This repository is essentially a conversation with myself where I am listing the topics that I want to learn and understand. Over the period of time I want to write my notes in comments and increase the knowledge bank.

## Topics Covered

- [**Agents and Multi-Agents**](./agents-and-multi-agents.md) - Comprehensive guide covering what agents are, multi-agent systems, and when to use different approaches vs tools
