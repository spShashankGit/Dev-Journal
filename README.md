# Dev-Journal
This repository is essentially a conversation with myself where I am listing the topics that I want to lean and understand. Over the period of time I want to write my notes in comments and increase the knowledge bank.

## Topics Covered

- [What is an IP?](what-is-an-ip.md) - Comprehensive guide to IP addresses, types, and practical applications for developers
