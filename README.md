# Dev-Journal
This repository is essentially a conversation with myself where I am listing the topics that I want to learn and understand. Over the period of time I want to write my notes in comments and increase the knowledge bank.

## Repository Structure

- **[Learning Topics Index](./learning-topics.md)** - Organized list of all learning topics with links to issues and documentation
- **Topic Documentation** - Detailed explanations and notes for specific topics (e.g., `vpc-to-vpn-connectivity.md`)
- **GitHub Issues** - Original questions and discussions for each learning topic

## How This Works

1. **Questions as Issues**: Each learning topic starts as a GitHub issue with a question
2. **Documentation**: Detailed answers and notes are created as markdown files in this repository
3. **Knowledge Index**: The learning topics index tracks all topics and their documentation status
4. **Continuous Learning**: This repository grows over time as new topics are explored and documented

## Getting Started

Browse the [Learning Topics Index](./learning-topics.md) to see all available topics organized by category. Topics marked with âœ… have detailed documentation available.
