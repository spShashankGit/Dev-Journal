# Dev-Journal
This repository is essentially a conversation with myself where I am listing the topics that I want to lean and understand. Over the period of time I want to write my notes in comments and increase the knowledge bank.

## Topics Covered

- [DRY Principle in Coding](DRY-Principle.md) - Understanding the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle with practical examples
- [SOLID Principles in Software Development](SOLID-Principles.md) - Comprehensive guide to the five fundamental principles of object-oriented design with TypeScript, Python, and Angular examples
