# Dev-Journal
This repository is essentially a conversation with myself where I am listing the topics that I want to learn and understand. Over the period of time I want to write my notes in comments and increase the knowledge bank.

## Topics Covered

### System Design & Reliability
- [Handling System Failures: When Source Systems Are Down](topics/handling-system-failures.md) - Comprehensive guide on dealing with system outages, implementing resilience patterns, and maintaining service availability during failures.

## Contributing to This Journal

This is a personal learning repository, but the knowledge documented here can be valuable for anyone interested in these topics. Each topic includes practical insights, implementation strategies, and best practices learned through experience and research.
