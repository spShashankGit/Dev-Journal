# Dev-Journal
This repository is essentially a conversation with myself where I am listing the topics that I want to learn and understand. Over the period of time I want to write my notes in comments and increase the knowledge bank.

## Topics Covered

### Storage and Networking
- **[What is NAS?](./topics/NAS.md)** - Comprehensive guide to Network Attached Storage, covering architecture, use cases, and comparisons with other storage solutions.

Each topic is documented in its own markdown file within the `topics/` directory. The documentation includes:
- Detailed explanations and definitions
- Use cases and practical applications
- Technical specifications and considerations

- Future trends and developments

Feel free to explore the topics and use this as a reference for learning and understanding various technology concepts.
