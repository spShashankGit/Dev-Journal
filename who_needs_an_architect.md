### Who Needs an Architect?

> I think that one of an architect’s most important tasks is to remove architecture by finding ways to eliminate irreversibility in software designs. - Pg 3

> Let’s forget the developers who just understand their little piece. Architecture is the highest level concept of the expert developers.

### Architecture
> “In most successful
software projects, the expert developers working
on that project have a shared understanding of the system design. This shared understanding
is called ‘architecture.’ This understanding
includes how the system is divided into
components and how the components interact through interfaces. These components are usually composed of smaller
components, but the architecture only includes the components and interfaces that
are understood by all the developers.”

> Architectus Reloadus is the person who makes all the important decisions. The architect does this because a single mind is needed to ensure a system’s conceptual integrity, and perhaps because the architect doesn’t think that the team members are sufficiently skilled to make those decisions. Often, such decisions must be made early on so that everyone else has a plan to follow.

### Day to Day Architect Job
> Architectus Oryzus is a different kind of animal (if you can’t guess, try www.nd.edu/~archives/latgramm.htm). This kind of architect must be very aware of what’s going on in the project, looking out for important issues and tackling them before they become a serious problem. When I see an architect like this, the most noticeable part of the work is the intense collaboration. In the morning, the architect programs with a developer, trying to harvest some common locking code. In the afternoon, the architect participates in a requirements session, helping explain to the requirements people the technical consequences of some of their ideas in nontechnical terms—such as development costs.

### One of the important activity of an Architect
> In many ways, the most important activity of Architectus Oryzus is to mentor the development team, to raise their level so that they can take on more complex issues.
>  Improving the development team’s ability gives an architect much greater leverage than being the sole decision maker and thus
running the risk of being an architectural bottleneck.

### Rule of thumb
> This leads to the satisfying rule of thumb that an architect’s value is inversely proportional to the number of decisions he or she makes.

### Another Metaphor for the Architect
> I’ve heard so far: guide, as in mountaineering. A guide is a more experienced and skillful team member who teaches other team members to better fend for themselves yet is always there for the really tricky stuff.
