Title: Expert Generalist

> Why does our attention keep drifting toward tool expertise? It isn't because people are shortsighted or lazy; it's because the fundamentals are hard to see amid the noise. Key ideas hide under stacks of product docs, YouTube tutorials, vendor blogs, and conference talks. At one end of the spectrum lie dense academic papers and university courses; at the other, vendor certifications tied to a single product. Connecting these dots — cutting through the surface to reach the essentials — takes deliberate effort.


> One proven aid is the language of patterns: reusable problem-solution pairs that capture the core principle without the brand labels. That's why we belive in investing in exploring, distilling, and sharing such patterns — so the industry conversation can shift from “Which tool should I learn next?” to “Which underlying principles and patterns must I master?”


> In our experience, the good grasp of this common language of patterns and principles also strengthens the product-service partnership. Today the relationship is often one-way: product teams ship features, service teams consume APIs. Product teams decide how to certify an engineer as an expert in a product and service teams aim to do those certifications. Cloud providers and tool vendors often demand a certain number of “certified professionals” before they will recognise a service provider as a competent partner. Yet our experience shows little correlation between certifications and competence. The focus on fundamentals pays off when competence is most needed: an engineer versed in Raft can untangle a Kubernetes control-plane stall that might puzzle several certified admins, and a Delta Lake write anomaly can be resolved from first-principles reasoning about optimistic-concurrency control instead of searching vendor docs. Once developers across roles share the lingua franca of a system's internals, the partnership becomes bidirectional — both sides can diagnose, propose, and refine solutions together. Better yet, the engineers who have a good grasp of the fundamentals are able to partner well with multiple product and platform teams, without needing to have product specific training for each product
