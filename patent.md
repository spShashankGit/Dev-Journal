## Is it patentable?

>
Inventions must solve technical problems, and under the EPC this means that solutions to purely business problems cannot be granted patent protection. For example, “super-sizing” deals on take-away food, or discounts to customers through “loyalty” schemes, may have been innovative ways to increase profit margins, but they lack “technical character” and so would not have been patentable.

#### Theory is not patentable, need to have a real world impact

>
Mere discoveries, theories or mathematical formulae are not patentable in isolation because they do not do anything useful (example: discovering a distant galaxy). However, if they are put into a practical context, the result could be patentable if it is also new and inventive. For example, the discovery of an unusual physical property of a liquid is not patentable, but the use of that liquid in a new hydraulic system based on this property might be. Similarly, a new mathematical formula for calculating the trajectory of a rocket would not be patentable in isolation, but when incorporated into the guidance system of a rocket to launch satellites, that guidance system might be patentable.

> Software is just lines of code, like lines of poetry. Devoid of context software is not useful and so not patentable. However, software when running on a device creates all sorts of useful technical effects, for example routing phone calls, operating a robot arm or compressing data. Many inventions implemented on computers are therefore perfectly patentable – and an increasing proportion of applications to the European Patent Office, in fields ranging from transport to healthcare, feature software at some level.
