# Architectural Patterns

Architectural patterns define the fundamental organization of software systems. They provide templates for organizing code at a high level and establish relationships between different components.

## MVC (Model-View-Controller)

**Purpose**: Separates application logic into three interconnected components.

**Components**:
- **Model**: Manages data and business logic
- **View**: Handles the presentation layer
- **Controller**: Manages user input and coordinates between Model and View

**Use Cases**:
- Web applications
- Desktop applications
- Mobile apps

**Benefits**:
- Separation of concerns
- Easier testing
- Parallel development

## MVP (Model-View-Presenter)

**Purpose**: Similar to MVC but the Presenter handles all UI logic.

**Key Differences from MVC**:
- View is more passive
- Presenter contains all presentation logic
- Better testability

**Use Cases**:
- Windows Forms applications
- Android applications (with Activities/Fragments)

## MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

**Purpose**: Separates business logic from UI through data binding.

**Components**:
- **Model**: Data and business logic
- **View**: UI components
- **ViewModel**: Binding layer between View and Model

**Use Cases**:
- WPF applications
- Angular applications
- React with state management

## Layered Architecture

**Purpose**: Organizes code into horizontal layers with specific responsibilities.

**Common Layers**:
1. **Presentation Layer**: UI and user interaction
2. **Business Layer**: Business logic and rules
3. **Data Access Layer**: Data persistence and retrieval
4. **Database Layer**: Data storage

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to maintain and test
- Scalable architecture

## Microservices Architecture

**Purpose**: Decomposes applications into small, independent services.

**Characteristics**:
- Service independence
- Technology diversity
- Decentralized governance
- Fault isolation

**Use Cases**:
- Large-scale applications
- Multi-team development
- Cloud-native applications

**Challenges**:
- Distributed system complexity
- Network latency
- Data consistency

## Event-Driven Architecture

**Purpose**: Uses events to trigger and communicate between services.

**Components**:
- **Event Producers**: Generate events
- **Event Consumers**: Process events
- **Event Brokers**: Route events

**Benefits**:
- Loose coupling
- Scalability
- Real-time processing

**Use Cases**:
- Real-time analytics
- IoT systems
- Notification systems

## Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

**Purpose**: Isolates core business logic from external concerns.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Ports**: Define interfaces
- **Adapters**: Implement interfaces
- **Core**: Business logic (isolated)

**Benefits**:
- Testability
- Technology independence
- Clean boundaries
