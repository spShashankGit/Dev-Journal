# Coding Patterns

This section contains documentation about different coding patterns that are commonly used in software development. Understanding these patterns is crucial for writing maintainable, scalable, and robust code.

## Table of Contents

### [Design Patterns](./design-patterns/)
Classical software design patterns that provide solutions to common design problems.

- **Creational Patterns**: Focus on object creation mechanisms
- **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition and relationships
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Focus on communication between objects and assignment of responsibilities

### [Architectural Patterns](./architectural-patterns/)
High-level patterns that define the overall structure of software applications.

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
- **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)**
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
- **Layered Architecture**
- **Microservices**
- **Event-Driven Architecture**

### [Programming Paradigms](./programming-paradigms/)
Different approaches to programming and problem-solving.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
