# Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are fundamental styles of computer programming that provide different approaches to solving problems and organizing code.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Core Principles**:

### Encapsulation
- Bundling data and methods that operate on that data
- Hiding internal implementation details
- Controlling access through access modifiers

### Inheritance
- Creating new classes based on existing ones
- Code reuse and establishing "is-a" relationships
- Method overriding and polymorphism

### Polymorphism
- Objects of different types responding to the same interface
- Method overloading and overriding
- Runtime type determination

### Abstraction
- Hiding complex implementation details
- Providing simplified interfaces
- Abstract classes and interfaces

**Use Cases**:
- Large applications with complex domain models
- GUI applications
- Game development
- Enterprise software

## Functional Programming

**Core Concepts**:

### Immutability
- Data doesn't change after creation
- Creating new data instead of modifying existing
- Avoiding side effects

### Pure Functions
- Functions that always return the same output for the same input
- No side effects
- Easier to test and reason about

### Higher-Order Functions
- Functions that take other functions as parameters
- Functions that return other functions
- Map, filter, reduce operations

### Function Composition
- Combining simple functions to build complex operations
- Chaining functions together
- Building pipelines of data transformation

**Benefits**:
- Easier debugging and testing
- Better concurrency support
- More predictable code

**Use Cases**:
- Data processing and transformation
- Mathematical computations
- Concurrent and parallel programming

## Procedural Programming

**Characteristics**:
- Code organized into procedures/functions
- Top-down approach
- Sequential execution
- Focus on actions rather than objects

**Structure**:
- Main function controls program flow
- Functions perform specific tasks
- Data passed between functions

**Use Cases**:
- System programming
- Scripting and automation
- Small to medium-sized programs
- Performance-critical applications

## Reactive Programming

**Core Concepts**:

### Observables/Streams
- Data as streams of events over time
- Asynchronous data handling
- Event-driven programming

### Operators
- Transform, filter, and combine streams
- Functional operations on data streams
- Composable data transformations

### Backpressure
- Handling fast producers and slow consumers
- Flow control mechanisms
- Preventing memory overflow

**Benefits**:
- Better handling of asynchronous operations
- Responsive user interfaces
- Simplified event handling

**Use Cases**:
- User interface programming
- Real-time data processing
- Network programming
- IoT applications

## Declarative vs Imperative Programming

### Imperative Programming
- **How** to do something
- Step-by-step instructions
- Control flow management
- Variable state changes

**Example**: Traditional loops, conditional statements

### Declarative Programming
- **What** you want to achieve
- Expressing logic without describing control flow
- Higher level of abstraction
- Focus on the end result

**Example**: SQL queries, functional programming operations

## Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

**Purpose**: Separating cross-cutting concerns from business logic.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Aspects**: Cross-cutting concerns (logging, security, etc.)
- **Join Points**: Points in program execution
- **Advice**: Code executed at join points
- **Pointcuts**: Define where advice applies

**Use Cases**:
- Logging and monitoring
- Security and authentication
- Transaction management
- Error handling
