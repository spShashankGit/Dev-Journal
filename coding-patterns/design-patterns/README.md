# Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They represent best practices and provide a common vocabulary for developers.

## Creational Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
**Purpose**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it.

**Use Cases**: 
- Database connections
- Logger instances
- Configuration settings

**Example Structure**:
```javascript
class Singleton {
    constructor() {
        if (Singleton.instance) {
            return Singleton.instance;
        }
        Singleton.instance = this;
    }
    
    static getInstance() {
        return new Singleton();
    }
}
```

### Factory Pattern
**Purpose**: Creates objects without specifying their exact classes.

**Use Cases**:
- Creating UI elements based on platform
- Database driver selection
- Payment processor selection

### Builder Pattern
**Purpose**: Constructs complex objects step by step.

**Use Cases**:
- Building SQL queries
- Creating configuration objects
- Form builders

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter Pattern
**Purpose**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

**Use Cases**:
- Third-party library integration
- Legacy system integration
- API wrapper creation

### Decorator Pattern
**Purpose**: Adds new functionality to objects without altering their structure.

**Use Cases**:
- Adding features to UI components
- Middleware in web frameworks
- Logging and monitoring

### Facade Pattern
**Purpose**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

**Use Cases**:
- API wrappers
- Complex library abstractions
- System integration layers

## Behavioral Patterns

### Observer Pattern
**Purpose**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.

**Use Cases**:
- Event handling systems
- Model-View architectures
- Notification systems

### Strategy Pattern
**Purpose**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.

**Use Cases**:
- Payment processing methods
- Sorting algorithms
- Validation strategies

### Command Pattern
**Purpose**: Encapsulates requests as objects.

**Use Cases**:
- Undo/redo functionality
- Queue operations
- Macro recording

*Each pattern solves specific design problems and should be used when the context matches the pattern's intent.*
