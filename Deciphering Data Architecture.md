# Deciphering Data Architectures

Data Mesh
Data Mesh is a decentralised data architecture with four specific characterstics.
1. It required independent teams within designated domains to own their analytics data.
2. In a data mesh, data is treated and served as a product to help the data consumer to discover, trust, and utlize it for whatever purpose they like.
3. It relied on automated infrastructure provisioning
4. It uses governance to ensure that all the independent data products are secure and follow global rules.


Traditional methods like manual ETL and siloed systems hinder scalability. Vendors such as Qlik, Denodo, Databricks, and Microsoft Fabric are addressing these bottlenecks by automating workflows, enhancing real-time analytics, and streamlining operations. According to Gergs, “Enterprises are looking to data fabrics for faster, smarter, and more efficient data handling.” Balancing customization for unique enterprise needs with scalable solutions is essential. But in all of this, the right balance between customization and standardization is critical for widespread adoption and long-term success.”

To overcome these challenges, vendors must go beyond delivering technology and providing comprehensive integration support, education, and ongoing collaboration with enterprises. “The key to success is not just selling a product but enabling a partnership. Vendors must walk together with enterprises, guiding them through integration, building workforce capabilities, and ensuring long-term value. A proactive and supportive approach will transform obstacles into opportunities,” Gergs advises.
