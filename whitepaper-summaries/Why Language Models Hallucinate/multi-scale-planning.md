# Multi Scale Planning

1. Root document or the core document - Rooted productivity.
- Important that everything is writtend down - that everything is how your system is working.


# Core Systems
Below are summaries of the three main categories that contain the elements of my core systems: 
1. Core documents
2. Productivity
3. Discipline

Core Document

Values
My roles and the values by which I try to live each of them.

Career and Personal Strategic Plans
I have one plan for each of these two parts of my life that lays out my current thoughts, experimental systems, and plan for living them true to my values. Sometimes these will also link to an extended plan when I have a big enough, long enough pursuit that it might need its own space.

Maintenance



Multi Scale Time Managment

Time Managment at work: 
1. What you will do with your time.

I love 
Capture
- Full Capture: Need to aÂ´have some pleace in which you store what is needed to be done, stored etc, you are not wasting what needs to be done.
- Brain gets worried when it has fear of forgetting the topic.

Configure 
- Care more about how you are organissing this information
- How is the topic broken down - by category, by role etc.
- Should be able to find out what is on your plate, what is not on your plate quickly.

Control
- Instead of being reactive of what you want to do with your time
- Instead be proactive i.e. make the best use of your time - so that you are making the most of your time which is available.
- Think ahead, and what I want to do next? 
- Do this type if planning on Quatery, Weekly and Daily.
-- Mon, Wed, Friday - I am doing the cold calls one hour in the morning. Doing this for the quarter. 
What are the big deadline this quarter, is there a trade-fair - that means first half has to be prepared for the quarter.
-- Every week you look at this quaterly plan and produce a plan for the week ahead of you. Weekly planning. - What is gonna happen on which day.
-- Finally on a daily scale - where you are actually saying what I am actually doing the hours of the day.

Constrain
