How to evaluate your cloud migration options?

Framework: Up or out
Claim: The frameowrk are devised after speaking with CIOs, CTOs and their technical staff. 

Why choose cloud? 
> The cost and business pressures facing IT organizations
today focus attention on value and adopting approaches
which allow focus and effort to be spent on the real jewels
of the organization—the data and services which power
insight and valuable outcomes.
Responsibilities on the organisations and thereby on teams is to make very good use of the time they gain due to offloading infrastructure manegement to cloud. Otherwise one can fall into the trap of "good times make weak people"

Insight: 
> Additionally, many enterprises rely on geographically distributed compute capacity and data storage that can’t be simply centralized into a single cloud data center. For example, most retail or manufacturing businesses have a significant IT footprint in branches or plants due to latency considerations or to assure continued operations in case of a network failure.

## Up 
> One choice you can make is to move your applications up the
stack, and this doesn’t necessarily imply a migration out onto a
cloud provider’s environment. As an initial step, you can
transition from running monolithic applications on dedicated
servers or virtual machines.

> Moving up the stack has several advantages:
-  Application deployment becomes automated, making it
easy to add or subtract capacity as needed, as well as
accelerating feature velocity.
- Operations also become more resilient because new
instances can be rapidly deployed in case of failure,
allowing Platform-as-a-Service or serverless platforms
to withstand a server failure without visible customer
impact.
- Thanks to smaller deployable units, hardware can be
more efficiently utilized, thus reducing run costs.
- Lastly, applications become more portable when they
are better isolated from infrastructure details, as their
containers may be deployed on a variety of
infrastructures. This paves the way for a hybrid cloud
scenario that provides a consistent service execution
environment across the entire estate, including cloud
vendors, on-prem data centers, branch locations, and
remote devices.

> Trade-off
> On the flipside, moving up the stack requires you to fundamentally change the way in which you build applications and operate the infrastructure that supports them. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you must migrate out into the cloud. Products like Anthos allow you to pursue service-centric cloud-native architectures even for workloads which must remain on-premises. 

## Out
> The second option is to lift, shift, and replatform existing applications largely unchanged out into the cloud, for example by moving virtual machines to Compute Engine or by replacing on-premises data archiving with cold-line Cloud Storage. Shifting workloads in the cloud can be simplified and even automated, for example by using tools like Migrate for Anthos.
> Advantages
> several advantages:
- Better economies of scale allow for more cost-efficient
operations
- Automated patching discipline improves security
because it assures that no software with known
vulnerabilities is run
- Increased transparency enables more efficient IT asset
management, for example by rightsizing servers or
detecting and retiring unused IT assets
- Ease of emerging technology adoption like machine
learning
- Improved security and access capabilities
- Enhanced resilience
