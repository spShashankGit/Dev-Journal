Why choose cloud? 
> The cost and business pressures facing IT organizations
today focus attention on value and adopting approaches
which allow focus and effort to be spent on the real jewels
of the organization—the data and services which power
insight and valuable outcomes.
Responsibilities on the organisations and thereby on teams is to make very good use of the time they gain due to offloading infrastructure manegement to cloud. Otherwise one can fall into the trap of "good times make weak people"

Insight: 
> Additionally, many enterprises rely on geographically distributed compute capacity and data storage that can’t be simply centralized into a single cloud data center. For example, most retail or manufacturing businesses have a significant IT footprint in branches or plants due to latency considerations or to assure continued operations in case of a network failure.
